## 2. What Information We Collect

We strive to collect as little personal data as possible directly from you. The App is designed to function without creating a user account or directly entering personally identifiable information such as name, address, or phone number.

### Automatically Collected Information (via Third-Party SDKs)

When you use the App and advertisements are displayed, our third-party advertising partners (especially Google AdMob) may automatically collect certain information. This includes:

*   **IP Address:** For approximate location determination and to deliver relevant advertising.
*   **Advertising ID (e.g., Google Advertising ID - GAID):** A unique, user-resettable ID for advertising purposes on mobile devices.
*   **Device Information:** Type of mobile device, operating system version, device settings (e.g., language).
*   **App Usage Information:** Information about how you interact with advertising in the App.
*   **Consent Information:** Via the Google User Messaging Platform (UMP), we collect your consent decisions regarding personalized advertising.

### Information You Provide Directly to Us

We do not collect personal data directly from you through input fields in the App, unless you contact us by email outside the App. In this case, we process your email address and the information contained in your request to respond to your inquiry.

## 3. How We Use Your Information

The information collected is used for the following purposes:

*   **Providing and Improving the App:** To provide the core functions of the App (recipes, information).
*   **Displaying Advertising:** To display advertising via Google AdMob, which enables the free provision of the App. This may include non-personalized and personalized advertising, provided you have given your explicit consent.
*   **Measuring Ad Performance:** To analyze the effectiveness of advertising campaigns.
*   **Compliance with Legal Obligations:** To comply with our legal obligations, particularly regarding the collection and management of advertising consents.
*   **Security and Fraud Prevention:** To protect our services and prevent fraudulent activities.
*   **Communication with You:** To respond to your inquiries when you contact us by email.

## 4. Sharing Your Information with Third Parties

We do not sell your personal data. We may share or allow access to information as follows with third parties:

*   **Advertising Partners (Google AdMob):** We use Google AdMob, an advertising service provided by Google LLC (or affiliated companies), to display advertising in our App. Google AdMob may collect and process information to display personalized or non-personalized advertising. We recommend that you read Google's privacy policy: [https://policies.google.com/privacy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).
*   **Legal Requirements:** We may disclose your information if we are legally required to do so or if we believe in good faith that such action is necessary.

## 5. Data Storage and Retention

We do not store personal data directly on our servers, as most data is processed by third parties like Google. Information you send to us by email will be retained for as long as necessary to process your request.

## 6. Your Data Privacy Rights

Depending on your location and applicable laws, you may have certain rights regarding your personal data. These include:

*   **Right to Information:** The right to receive information about the data we process about you.

You can restrict the use of your Advertising ID for personalized advertising in your mobile device settings or reset the ID.
